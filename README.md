# Working
This RFID reader includes a radio frequency module. Also, the antenna coil included here produces a high-frequency electromagnetic field. This RFID tag is made up of an antenna and electronic microchip. This electronic microchip in the RFID Tag produces a voltage in the antenna coil of the RFID Reader due to the induction of the electromagnetic field generated when it is placed near an RFID Reader. For this reason, an RFID Reader can detect an RFID Tag.
